ContactFormApplication

Steps on how to make the frontend (Virtual Assistant Portfolio) and the backend (Spring Boot application) work together. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.Set up the backend: KingTsonga Java backend 
a. Ensure your Spring Boot application is complete and running correctly. 
b. Run the Spring Boot application. It should start on http://localhost:8080 by default.

2.Update the frontend: 
a. Open the Virtual Assistant Portfolio project. 
b. Locate the contact form component (likely in src/components/Contact.jsx). 
c. Update the form submission handler to send a POST request to your backend. Replace the existing handleSubmit function with:

const handleSubmit = async (e) => { e.preventDefault(); setIsSubmitting(true);

try { const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/contact', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }, body: JSON.stringify(formData), });

if (response.ok) {
  setIsSubmitSuccessful(true);
  setFormData(initialState);
} else {
  throw new Error('Failed to submit form');
}
} catch (error) { console.error('Error:', error); setIsSubmitSuccessful(false); } finally { setIsSubmitting(false); } };


3.Configure CORS (if needed):
The backend is already configured to accept requests from any origin. If you need to restrict this, update the @CrossOrigin annotation in the ContactController class:

@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:5173") // Replace with your frontend URL

4.Test the integration: 
a. Start your Spring Boot backend (it should be running on http://localhost:8080). 
b. Start your frontend development server (likely using npm run dev or yarn dev). 
c. Open your frontend application in a web browser. d. Navigate to the contact form and submit a test message. e. Check your backend console for any log messages about receiving the request. f. Verify that you receive the email with the form submission details.

5.Handle environment-specific configurations:
For production, you'll want to use environment variables or configuration files to set the correct backend URL. 
In your frontend code, you might use:

const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8080'; // Then use ${API_URL}/api/contact in your fetch call

6.Deploy both applications: 
a. Deploy your Spring Boot application to a server or cloud platform of your choice. 
b. Deploy your React frontend to a static hosting service or a server. 
c. Ensure that the deployed frontend is configured with the correct URL for the deployed backend.

7.Update security settings: 
a. In a production environment, implement proper security measures like HTTPS. 
b. Consider adding authentication if the contact form should only be accessible to authenticated users.

8.Monitor and maintain:
Set up logging and monitoring for both your frontend and backend to track usage and quickly identify any issues.

Remember, these steps assume a basic setup. 
Depending on your specific requirements and deployment environment, you might need to make additional adjustments.
